    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with
        some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the
        entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which
        they can trust nobody, least of all each other.
        Grand Theft Auto V for PC offers players the option to explore the award-winning world of Los Santos and Blaine
        County in resolutions of up to 4k and beyond, as well as the chance to experience the game running at 60 frames
        per second.
        The game offers players a huge range of PC-specific customization options, including over 25 separate
        configurable settings for texture quality, shaders, tessellation, anti-aliasing and more, as well as support and
        extensive customization for mouse and keyboard controls. Additional options include a population density slider
        to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and
        plug-and-play controller support.
        Grand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators.
        Grand Theft Auto Online for PC will include all existing gameplay upgrades and Rockstar-created content released
        since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including Heists and Adversary modes.
        The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online features First Person Mode, giving players the
        chance to explore the incredibly detailed world of Los Santos and Blaine County in an entirely new way.
        Grand Theft Auto V for PC also brings the debut of the Rockstar Editor, a powerful suite of creative tools to
        quickly and easily capture, edit and share game footage from within Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto
        Online. The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent
        story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera
        manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add
        their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score.
        Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to YouTube and the Rockstar Games Social Club
        for easy sharing.
        Soundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station
        features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original
        soundtrack. Collaborating guest artists include Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, Little Dragon, Killer Mike, Sam
        Herring from Future Islands, and more. Players can also discover Los Santos and Blaine County while enjoying
        their own music through Self Radio, a new radio station that will host player-created custom soundtracks.
